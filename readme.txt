== Installation ==

Install the plugin, and activate it.  Go to your admin menu and look for the left hand menu called "Instant FAQ Plugin Menu".
Add your Questions and Answers (there are only 10 now, I will be adding more options/functionality later).  Then create
a new page called "Frequently Asked Questions" or whatever else you want.  Add the shortcode {instantfaqpage}.  That
page will be transformed into a Frequently Asked Questions page instantly.  Easy to update, easy to keep track of.

More features/functionality will be added later, and upon request.
